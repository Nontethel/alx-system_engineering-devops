Love not - thou canst not - dost not - adieu!

In youth I loved thee with a love sincere
A love more calm and deep than word or tear

Now, woman's fleeting joys are overpaid
And as they fly their splendor fades away

While yet my brow was free from guilty shade
Thy blushing cheek bespoke thee not of clay
